# StarkDebtAllocator
The objective of this PoC is decentralizing even more the process to choose strategy weights within a vault. 

StarkDebtAllocator is the contract in charge of receiving and validating debt ratio proposals, that will come from any proposer.  

It uses (zk-)STARKS through Starware's Cairo, SHARP prover and L1 verifier to generate proofs that make it possible to be sure that they are valid solutions without spending a ton of gas running the computation on-chain.	

To incentivize people running the calculations and proposing solutions, the solution proposer will earn rewards during the time their solution is used. 	

## Intro (problem)
Currently, debt ratios are proposed by vault managers and approved by a multisig. Vault managers analyze how each of the strategies is performing, checking their different APYs and then come up with a set of debt ratios, which are set manually. 

{	
    "strategy1": 2500,
    "strategy2": 2500,
    "strategy3": 3500,	
    "strategy4": 1500	
}	

This process requires manual intervention and brings a lot of overhead with it.	

## Solution	


This is a PoC is composed of 2 parts: L1 smart contract and Cairo Program	

StarkDebtAllocator is one Ethereum L1 smart contract. 	

It implements three main components:
- add/update/remove strategy():	Give all the necessary info to get on-chain data for a strategy, hash them all and save the hash
- saveSnapshot(): reads all the on-chain data that will be used as inputs for the Cairo Program and hashes them all, then saves the hash. 
- verifySolution(uint256[] programOutput): 	
	- Check not staled Snapshot (we need to make sure we calculate the APY with fresh data)
	- parses programOutput to the following values: inputsHash (to check if data used in the cairo program are valid), currentTargetAllocation, newTargetAllocation, current_solution and new_solution.
 (Note that cairo felt isn't big enought to support 256 bits (252 bits max), that's why 2 slot of the programOutput are used to calculate the input hash from strategies input, 128 bits each)	
	- checks that the new solution is better than the previous solution, for user experience purpose, a minimum increase is necessary so the proposer won't change for a certain moment. Also the current solution is calculated in the cairo script better than the saved one in storage so we make sure we get real the current APY (with valid inputs).
	- checks that the CairoVerifier from Starkware has received the proof and confirmed it is correct	
	- sets the new winning solution, the new debt ratio array and store the address of the user and his performance.	
	- Then we can reward the last proposer with llamapay

apy_calculator.cairo is the Cairo program that takes the on-chain data from save-snapshot and calculates the APR for the current TargetAllocation and the new TargetAllocation. This Cairo program will also compute a hash of all the inputs it has used to calculate APYs to send it to the L1 smart contract, so inputs can be validated.

## How to use
The SETUP is only done by yearn governance. It is included here for the sake of completeness

Proposers only need to execute Operations steps

### Operations
#### Find your solution
Use your own mechanism to find the optimal debt allocation

Once you have found a debt allocation, modify `scripts/config_mainnet.json` with your new debt allocation
```
  "new_allocation_array": <<NEW_ARRAY>>,
```

#### Sync latest data 
Run 
```
ape run ops_000_sync_data
```

This will read the last setup of strategies and the data required to calculate their APR

#### Save (or reuse) a snapshot with current data
Snapshots are used to make sure that the Cairo Program uses recent data coming from the blockchain

Run
```
ape run ops_01a_save_snapshot
```
to take your own snapshot. This will save the current state of the blockchain (cost gas)

or 
```
ape run ops_01b_sync_last_snapshot
```
to use the last valid snapshot (free gas)

#### Generate Proof of valid result
Run
```
ape run ops_02a_send_proof
```

Once run, you can monitor the status of the proof generation (and its on-chain verification) by running (it can take up to 1hr)
```
ape run ops_02b_monitor_proof_status
```

#### Send and verify solution
Run
```
ape run ops_03a_verify_solution
```

This will also update the vault allocation

## Calculation Logic

Each Strategy APY is calculated in the cairo program hash. Better than modifying the cairo program every time a new strategy is added (which involves modifying the cairo program hash on the debtAllocator contract), the strategy APY calculation is given as an input. 

The calculation follow this logic: 

Each step performs an operation of 2 operands.
The operand is between 0 and 10000, we take the value of the input data
The operand is between 10000 and 20000, we take the value of the last calculation steps.
The operand is more than 20000, we take the value - 20 000
the operation is described by a uint, 0 = +, 1 = -, 2 = x, 3 = /

Exemple for a strategy: 
Input: [4,7,2]
Calculation_logic: [4, 1,0,0, 10000,2,2, 10001,20010,1, 10002,2,3]

step0 -> 7(input 1) + 4 (input 0)

step1 -> 11 (step0) * 2 (input 2)

step2 -> 22 (step1) - 10 (20010 - 20000)

step3 -> 12(step2) / 2 (input 2)

res = 6 âœ¨

The Strategy APR can be different following some conditions.

The cairo script can perfom calculations and check if the last step is lower or equal to a value. If it does, a new calculation tab is extracted from the original one, following the offset and the new calculation len.

Condition logic: [2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 20002, 1, 10001, 10000, 26, 20]

Step 0 ->  4 (input 0) x 2 (input 2)

Step 1 ->  7 (input 1) - 2 (20002 - 20000)

FinalStep ->  5(step1) <= 8(step0) ? 
yes -> jump offset 26 and tab len = 20

## Add a new Strategy

To add a new strategy, the first step is to know about all the on-chain data you need to calculate your strategy APR.
You need for each data: The contract address, the selector(4bytes), the calldata (32bytes array), the offset (maybe the returned data is a tupple so you need to select the good arg).
Once you have all the required data, write your calculation and conditions step. 
When you are ready, write a script in the same format than scripts/setup/testnet/add_AaveV2_strategy.py

## Requirements
